The script logic.js accesses the user's mapbox API key in config.js and displays a map with circular markers representing earthquakes within the past 7 days. The circles are redder according to measured depth, and larger radii according to magnitude (multiplied by a scalar for visibility). Clicking on any marker will display additional information.
